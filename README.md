# ECE 49022 Project - MIDI Conversion
The goal of this project was to create a device which could transform the analog output of a guitar into MIDI over USB. 
Unfortunately it doesn't work very well for actual guitar output, and I fried the hell out of all my usb ports so it outputs over serial instead. 
The pitch detection algorithm is dywapitchtrack, available [here](https://github.com/antoineschmitt/dywapitchtrack), under an MIT license.
